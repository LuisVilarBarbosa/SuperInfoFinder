# SuperInfoFinder
The SuperInfoFinder project is a crawler that finds web pages that fulfill a given regular expression (regex).

After giving an initial web page, this crawler will check how many times that web page fulfills the provided regex, output that information to the console and to a file, and perform the same actions for all web pages found referenced inside the processed web page.

This crawler is written in Java and, for that reason, it was developed using IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition) as development environment.

Conceptually speaking, this crawler is partially based on https://github.com/ivivanov/JavaWebCrawler/blob/201ca7cccfee4ee6af71484fb885dd6b591b96b4/README.md
